-- write more examples, make some demo/presentation
-- details view:
   matchrules, number of wakeups because of each?
   emphasize processes somehow (group counts by pid), ugh..
   say in details view group by pid
-- selective dbus monitor functionality with timestamps:
   maybe decode arguments? (later)
   "i want to monitor messages like X"
-- other stats, max woken, median woken?
-- selection of clients:
   add/remove to selection?
   (transitive closure of {app and clients sending to it})
-- "future" selection: add to selection when messages come.  needs
   selection-rules; probably not worth
-- colors:
   monitor mode: color replies based on turnaround time (how long it took)
   need to track pending calls
   if we already track them, detail view can be extended to show the call
   that a reply was response for...
-- account for service activation (ListActivatableNames and check if
   a message activated a service)
-- bling: graphviz output for TPOs (connect active clients)
   tried, too messy, needs more thinking
-- select clients based on their sent/received messages:
   who sent to this service?
   who received from this client?
-- think about the output, make it more machine parseable and human readable
-- should we redirect stderr to stdout?	 make them the same.
-- redirect/tee output to some file at runtime?
-- command-specific completion
   by making Command object more featureful
