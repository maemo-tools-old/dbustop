-- write more examples, make some demo/presentation
-- details
   matchrules, number of wakeups because each?
   messages per type (type+interface+member) per destination or sender
   group by pid?
   sort detail by count
-- selective dbus monitor functionality with timestamps
   maybe decode arguments? (later)
   "i want to monitor messages like X"
-- redirect/tee output to some file at runtime
-- other stats, max woken, median woken?
-- selection of clients
   add/remove to selection?
   (transitive closure of {app and clients sending to it})
-- think about the output, make it more machine parseable and human readable
-- colors:
   monitor mode: color replies based on turnaround time (how long it took)
   need to track pending calls
   if we already trackthem, detail view can be extended to show the call
   that a reply was response for...
-- account for service activation (ListActivatableNames and check if
   a message activated a service)
-- maybe emphasize processes somehow (group counts by pid), ugh..
   say in details view group by pid
-- bling: graphviz output for TPOs (connect active clients)
-- select clients "who sent this message"
   who sent to this interface/service?
   what we can do now:
   who sent to this destination?
   who received from this?
-- "future" selection?  add to selection when messages come.  needs
   selection-rules
-- should we redirect stderr to stdout?	 make them the same.
-- command-specific completion
   by making Command object more featureful
-- err, we lost owned names of exited clients, because they lose them.
   what to do?
